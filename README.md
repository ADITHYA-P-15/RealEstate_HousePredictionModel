# Real Estate House Price Prediction - Bengaluru

A comprehensive Machine Learning project designed to accurately predict house prices in Bengaluru using multiple regression models. 
This project combines data-driven modeling with an interactive web interface to deliver real-time price estimates based on user inputs.

## Features:

- Uses trained models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Trees.
- Takes user input from a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Backend logic is developed in Python using Flask, handled via PyCharm IDE.
- Predicts house prices in lakhs based on the user input.

## How It Works:

- The ML models are trained on real estate data of Bengaluru.
- The website accepts inputs like location, size, and other features.
- The backend (Python) processes the inputs and returns a predicted price.

## How to Run:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, Flask).
3. Run the Python backend to serve the prediction API.
4. Open the website files (`index.html`) in a browser.
5. Enter house details and get the price prediction.

## Technologies Used:

- Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib , Scikit-Learn, Flask)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Machine Learning models: Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Trees
